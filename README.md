# K-Means-Clustering

ABSTRACT : A key challenge for e-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the e-commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.


PROBLEM STATEMENT : Given the e-commerce data, use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interest.


APPROACH : To group similar customers into clusters using their behavioral or demographic attributes for targeted business strategies.


Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn


Key Steps:
	•	Performed data preprocessing including normalization and handling of missing values.
	•	Applied Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
	•	Implemented K-Means Clustering algorithm for segmenting customers.
	•	Visualized clusters using scatter plots and pair plots to interpret segment characteristics.
	•	Analyzed each cluster to provide actionable insights for marketing or product development.

 
Outcome: Successfully segmented data into meaningful customer groups, demonstrating how unsupervised learning can uncover hidden patterns in datasets without labeled outputs.
